Your farm keeps expanding even while you‚Äôre away: crops grow relentlessly and pests appear alongside them. To keep your plants alive and healthy, water them regularly and apply pesticides when necessary.
Sell your harvest on a dynamic market where prices shift in real time, driven by in-game news, so stay alert. 
Combine smart farming practices with trading strategy: buy vegetables at their lowest price and sell at peak demand to maximize profit.
Move wisely, balance farm care with market speculation, and transform your fields into a high-tech profit empire!

How Does Artificial Intelligence Work in the Game?

1. AI Newspaper ‚Äì ‚ÄúDaily Agro News‚Äù
What it is: An AI‚Äêpowered editor that publishes a short daily ‚Äúnewspaper‚Äù filled with headlines, forecasts, rumors, and scandals from the agricultural world.

How it works: AI analyzes real player actions (what they plant or buy) together with global world parameters and generates three to five relevant news items.

In-game impact: Creates an ever-shifting information backdrop that prompts players to react (buy/sell, insure crops, change plantings), making the world feel alive and unpredictable.

2. Self-Learning Market
What it is: An economic controller that constantly adjusts prices to keep supply and demand in balance.

How it works: A deep Q-network monitors every player‚Äôs inventory and trading history, acts as a market maker, and can inject controlled price volatility.

In-game impact: A highly liquid marketplace with no manual tweaking, opening the door to genuine speculation and coordinated ‚Äúcartels.‚Äù

3. ‚ÄúButterfly Effect‚Äù Global Events
What it is: Large-scale events‚Äîtrade wars, plant viruses, pest swarms, droughts‚Äîthat radically alter the rules of play.

How it works: AI crafts the storyline, while a causal-impact model checks whether the knock-on effects on climate, yields, and prices remain coherent.

In-game impact: Players receive a periodic shake-up every X weeks; they must adapt quickly, rethink strategy, and cooperate to survive.

4. AI Quest-Maker
What it is: A task dispatcher that issues global quests with meaningful rewards.

How it works: The AI proposes social missions such as:

‚ÄúGrow 100 tons of tomatoes without pesticides.‚Äù

‚ÄúForm a fertilizer cartel and maintain a monopoly for 7 days.‚Äù

‚ÄúStore more than 100 tons of cucumbers for 5 consecutive days.‚Äù

In-game impact: Adds fresh motivation, new cooperative scenarios, and endless replayability‚Äîwithout the need for human scriptwriters.
